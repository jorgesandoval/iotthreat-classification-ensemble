## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The notebook explores the application of various machine learning models to the domain of IoT security, with a focus on threat classification. It culminates in the creation of an ensemble model that integrates the predictions of multiple models to enhance accuracy and reliability. The performance of each model is meticulously measured using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, and the results are compared to identify the most effective approach.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

* **File Name**: `iot_threat_data.csv`
* **Description**: The dataset comprises features extracted from network traffic, indicative of potential IoT threats. It undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values and is then used for feature selection and model training.

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

To run the notebook, you'll need the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-threat-classification-ensemble.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the cloned directory and open the Jupyter notebook"**

    ```bash
        cd iot-threat-classification-ensemble
        jupyter notebook
    ```
3. **Run the notebook**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train the XGBoost model, and evaluate its performance.
## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

* **Ensemble Model**: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 88.43%, with a precision score slightly higher than its accuracy, indicating that the model's predictions are quite reliable.
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Exhibited nearly equivalent accuracy to the ensemble model, with notably higher precision, suggesting a high percentage of correct positive predictions.
* **Neural Network**: Ranked third in accuracy, but with a lower precision compared to its accuracy, indicating potential over-prediction in certain classes.
* **Gradient Boosting**: Showcased the highest precision among the top models, although with slightly lower accuracy than the Neural Network, suggesting very reliable positive predictions.
* **Random Forest & Extra Trees**: Both models demonstrated almost identical accuracy and precision scores, performing well in accuracy but with room for improvement in precision.
* **Decision Tree**: Performed on par with the Random Forest and Extra Trees models, as expected due to the nature of Random Forests being ensembles of Decision Trees.
* **Logistic Regression & SVM**: These models had similar accuracy scores but lower precision than the top-performing models, indicating a higher number of false positive predictions.
* **Gaussian Naive Bayes**: Despite ranking last in accuracy, it had a high precision score, nearly matching that of the Gradient Boosting model, suggesting that its positive predictions are highly reliable.

The ensemble approach demonstrated the benefit of combining multiple models to improve prediction reliability and accuracy, outperforming individual models in overall metrics.
